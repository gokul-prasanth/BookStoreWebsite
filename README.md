# BookStoreWebsite

Evergreen Books Co. is a company that sells various kinds of paper books via its chain of several bookshops throughout the country. With the popularity of Internet and customer’s shopping habit has shifted to online, the company’s director board decides to expand its business to serve those online customers. A key strategy of its business movement is building a website that allows their customers to order the books they want while sitting at home. The ordered books will be shipped to the customer’s address in few days, and the customers pay cash upon receiving the books (Cash on Delivery or COD).

In the backend, the company needs to maintain a group of people who put book’s information on the website and manages customer’s information along with their orders.
